# FREDHEAD
A Simple Dashboard for St. Louis FED Data

## Using the App

The app can be accessed [here](https://jaylamb20.shinyapps.io/FREDHEAD).

## About the Project

FRED-HEAD was designed in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the ["Developing Data Products"](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) MOOC on Coursera, one of nine courses in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) offered by professors at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg SChool of Public Health.

In the course, we cover topics related to the development of reproducible, interactive, visually stimulating representations of data analyses. Popular examples include the following.
   
- Shiny apps
- R packages
- RMarkdown documents
- Interactive visualizations (using GoogleVis and rCharts)
- Slidify presentations

The FRED-HEAD app, in its original version, was submitted as my final project for this course.
