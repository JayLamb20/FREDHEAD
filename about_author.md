### About the Author

I am a business economist and aspiring data scientist living and working near Boston, MA. I hold a B.S. in Business Economics & Marketing and an M.S. in Applied Economics from Marquette University, in Milwaukee, WI. Since leaving Marquette, I have been working as an analyst at economic consultancy [IHS Economics](https://www.ihs.com/industry/economics-country-risk.html) in Lexington, MA, where I specialize in econometrics and forecasting.

I am also a Signature Track student in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. In this program, I have had the opportunity to learn much about R programming, reproducible research, statistics, machine learning, and more.
