<h3>Why Should I Care About This App?</h3>

FRED-HEAD is intended to offer a simple solution for viewing the most recent macroeconomic indicators from the St. Louis Federal Reserve's FRED database. 

FRED's built-in visualization tools are great, but setting up your own multiseries graphs on their site take a bit of effort. This applications allows you to get a quick and interactive view of the most important macroeconomic series in FRED, in a way that facilitates comparison across similar concepts.  

<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>

I hope that you enjoy this simple app. The brief documentation below explains the functionality of each page within the app.

<h4>Plot</h4>

When you navigate to the application, it should open on the "Plot" page. This page contains the following features:

1. Use the drop-down on the left to select a concept. When you do, the line chart on the right will change.
2. Try hovering your mouse over a point on one of the lines. rCharts will provide you with a useful popup giving the concept name and point estimate.
3. If you want to view the raw data and explore other series, try clicking the link under the drop-down, which will take you directly to the [FRED homepage](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/).
4. That's it!

<h4>Documentation</h4>
This page (which you are already on!) contains this simple set of instructions for using the app. In addition, the underlying code are provided for your reference.

<h4>Additional Resources</h4>

This is a bibliography of sorts, used to store references to all of the online resources used in the creation of the app. I hope that you find as much value in them as I did.
